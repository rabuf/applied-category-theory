You can register at left using your full real name as username.\nI haven't carefully counted, but so far about 150 of you have registered, and I see 27 more applicants whom I haven't gotten around to approving.  A bunch of you have written self-introductions; I haven't gotten around to responding to all these yet either - but it's obvious we've got a formidable team here.  If we work together we can do amazing things.  \nI decided to teach an online course because I was getting bored of the superficial engagement I'd been getting on my social media posts, mainly on Google+, which started out great but has been going downhill.   I like to explain things, discuss things and learn things by talking to people.   I've been doing this for decades, first on sci.physics.research, and later on the n-Category Café, the Azimuth blog... and the Azimuth Forum here, which began life as a platform for creating a wiki about environmental issues: the Azimuth Wiki.  All these fora were great fun, but it seems each one gets a bit stale after a while, so it's time for something new.\nI decided to teach a course on \"applied category theory\" because that's what I'm working on, and my former student Brendan Fong is doing a postdoc with David Spivak at MIT, and they taught a course on this subject and turned it into a very nice book that you can download for free:\n\nBrendan Fong and David Spivak, Seven Sketches in Compositionality: An Invitation to Applied Category Theory. \n\nOur course will be based on this book.   I'll give \"lectures\" on it - in print, like this one here - from now until at most September 25th, when I have to start teaching classes at U. C. Riverside again.  The book has 7 chapters, and we've got at most 6 months.  I don't have a set time-table: we'll have to see how things go.  We could be done much sooner, but it may be fun to go slower and get into more detail.\nI will try to write a short lecture every day or so, sometimes more than one.  But sometimes I'll be busy: most notably, from April 23rd to May 5th, Brendan, David and I will be in the Netherlands at Applied Category Theory 2018, along with 60 other people, and things will get very hectic.   Expect a slowdown or complete silence then.  With luck you can watch videos.\nWe should do all the Exercises in the book.   I hope some of you volunteer to copy these exercises over to the Forum, one at a time, so we can talk about them here.  I'll get the game started but I can't do everything.\nI will also pose Puzzles.   In fact I've already started!\nSo, your job is to read the book, ask questions, try to do the Exercises and Puzzles, write your answers here - and most importantly, discuss everything to death!   There will be a place to discuss each Chapter, and a place to discuss each Lecture and these discussions can go on indefinitely.   \nI will take part in these discussions - that's what I love about online forums.   But if all of you ask lots of questions - and I really hope you do! - I'll be unable to answer them all myself.  So, it's crucial that if someone asks a question, and you think you know the answer, help them out.\nWith luck, we'll all learn a lot of stuff, make a lot of new friends... and some of us will go ahead to revolutionize human thought, invent amazing new technologies, and save the planet.   \nGetting to Know Each Other\nIf you're new to the Azimuth Forum, please post a comment about your interests and background in the category Chat.      A lot of you have already done this.   So, go read some - and reply to at least one!  Pick one that hasn't gotten any replies yet.  I want to go through them all and reply to every one, but it will take me a while.  If you get to know some other people in the course, it'll be a lot more fun.\nI'd like to keep the discussions on Chapters (of the book) and Lectures (like this) fairly focused.  There is always conversation drift, and some of that is okay, but if you start wanting to talk about algebraic geometry or sky-diving or something else that's not really about the course, please take it to Chat.  That's a good place for free-wheeling discussions.   \nDiscussions \nYou discuss the Chapters by posting a comment on the appropriate thread, like this:\n\nChapter 1.\n\nYou can discuss my Lectures by posting a comment on its thread.  If you have questions or comments on the subject of the course that don't quite fit into any of these places, you can start a new discussion in the category Applied Category Theory Course.     If you have questions about technical aspects of how the Azimuth Forum works - or why it's not working - start a discussion in the category Technical.   \nWriting math \nYou can write equations using MathJax, which is a limited version of LaTeX good for the web.  For \"displayed\" equations, centered on the page, use double dollar signs: {% math %}E = \\sqrt{m^2 + p^2}{% endmath %} produces this: E = \\sqrt{m^2 + p^2}   For \"inline\" equations, mixed in with your text, use this other method: \\\\(E = \\sqrt{m^2 + p^2}\\\\) produces this: \\(E = \\sqrt{m^2 + p^2}\\).  If you don't know anything about LaTeX, you can look at the source code of other people's comments and see how they're doing stuff.\nResources\nThe book Seven Sketches has a bibliography with some good reference.  Wikipedia is actually very good for definitions of terms used in category theory.  For more advanced material, see the nLab. Also try these free books:\n\nTom Leinster, Basic Category Theory, Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics, Vol. 143, Cambridge University Press, 2014.  (An introduction.)\n\nEmily Riehl, Category Theory in Context, Dover, New York, 2016.  (More advanced.)  \n\n\nBe nice\nIt's an inevitable feature of any discussion forum that some users become rude, bully others, try to take over conversations, or try to promote irrelevant ideas.  Anyone who becomes annoying in these or other ways will be banned.   I won't allow discussions about these issues, either.   I have been helping run online discussion forums since around 1989, back when we used modems, and I've learned that requiring politeness is the only way to keep attention focused on the actual subject matter.   If you don't want to be polite and respectful of others, please leave now.\nPro tip: if someone says something idiotic, like \"all categories have colimits\", don't say \"You're wrong.\"   Say \"Actually not all categories have colimits: consider for example the category of free groups and homomorphisms between those.\"  It's amazing how much better people respond when they don't perceive a correction as being an attack on their person.   People are incredibly sensitive things.\n"},"chapter_1/lecture_2.html":{"url":"chapter_1/lecture_2.html","title":"Lecture 2 - What is Applied Category Theory?","keywords":"","body":"\"Applied category theory\" is fairly new, and I should warn you right away that it's just getting started.   While I can point you to some great applications of category theory outside mathematics and computer science, if you ask \"have categories been successfully applied to X?\" there's a high chance the answer will be no, even if such an application is possible!  It takes time.\nCategory theory was created in 1947.  It was created to be applied. Mathematicians were having problems connecting topology to algebra, and Eilenberg and Mac Lane realized that 3 new concepts were required to solve these problems: category, functor, and natural transformation.  They succeeded wonderfully, and category theory started growing rapidly: it is now indispensable in the subject of \"algebraic topology\", which solves topology problems using algebra.  Later Grothendieck applied category theory to \"algebraic geometry\", and used it to prove the Weil Conjectures, some amazing conjectures relating number theory to geometry.  In the process he invented many other fundamental concepts, like topoi, or toposes.  By now category theory is a very large subject that takes a long time to thoroughly learn.\nHowever, these are applications within pure mathematics, and the new buzzword \"applied category theory\" refers to applications outside pure mathematics.  \nIt also mainly means applications outside computer science.\nCategory theory has been applied to computer science for a long time now, at least since the 1960s.  That's why a lot of you - maybe even most of you - are hackers, programmers, software designers, or computer scientists.  You've heard that category theory is good for you.  You probably heard that before the new buzzword \"applied category theory\".\n I'm not a programmer.  I apologize for this flaw.  I know a fair amount about categories in computer science - but I learned it from the category theory side, not from hands-on experience in programming.   For example, I understood monads before I heard of Haskell, and my first reaction was \"What are these guys doing with monads?  How are they managing to make such a simple concept so mysterious?\"   I understood cartesian closed categories before I understood the lambda calculus, and I can't imagine myself understanding the lambda calculus without category theory (though plenty of people do).\nSo, this is not a course on \"categories in computer science\".  Nonetheless, because category theory is about understanding and organizing abstract data structures, everything I say will be relevant in some way to computing!  Furthermore, several chapters in Seven Sketches explicitly discuss databases, and type systems, and other aspects of computer science.   \nIn the 1990s people started applying category theory to quantum physics, and quantum gravity.  That's how I got interested in category theory!   There are a lot of success stories here by now.   And if people succeed in building topological quantum computers, we'll see technology that can only be understood using category theory.\nMore recently, some of us decided that if categories are good for computer science and physics, maybe we should apply them elsewhere: engineering, chemistry, biology and beyond.  That's what I'm doing now.   I'm applying categories in the DARPA-funded project on complex adaptive system design, I'm being paid by the Silicon Valley startup Pyrofex to do research in category theory, and I've got 8 grad students and a postdoc studying networks using category theory.  And it's not just us - it's catching on.\nIt's this incipient spread of category theory into many areas of science and engineering that people mean when they say \"applied category theory\".  \nI held a workshop on it last year.  You can see slides and videos here:\n\nApplied Category Theory, AMS Western Sectional Meeting, U. C. Riverside, 4-5 November 2017. \n\nThis month Spencer Breiner and Eswaran Subrahmanian ran a workshop pulling together academics and lots of honchos from industry and government:\n\nApplied Category Theory: Bridging Theory & Practice, 15-16 March 2018, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA.\n\nThey took videos and collected talk slides, but for now you can only read my description - click the link.  \nAt the end of April there will be a much bigger week-long school followed by a week-long workshop in the Netherlands:\n\nApplied Category Theory (ACT 2018).  School 23-27 April 2018 and workshop 30 April-4 May 2018 at the Lorentz Center in Leiden, the Netherlands.  Organized by Bob Coecke (Oxford), Brendan Fong (MIT), Aleks Kissinger (Nijmegen), Martha Lewis (Amsterdam), and Joshua Tan (Oxford).\n\nThere should be a lot to see on YouTube!  I'll be there, and I'll keep you informed.\nThese are all the events I know that have \"applied category theory\" in the title.    The applications have been building up over decades, but only now have they reached a critical mass, to make it a subject with its own name.  \nThe book by Fong and Spivak is a great introduction to category theory as viewed from this new perspective.  So that's what we'll talk about here!\n"},"chapter_1/lecture_3.html":{"url":"chapter_1/lecture_3.html","title":"Lecture 3 - Posets","keywords":"","body":"Okay, let's get started!  \nFong and Spivak start out by explaining posets, which is short for \"partially ordered sets\".   Whenever you have a set of things and a reasonable way deciding when anything in that set is \"bigger\" than some other thing, or \"more expensive\", or \"taller\", or \"heavier\", or \"better\" in any well-defined sense, or... anything like that, you've got a poset.  When \\(y\\) is bigger than \\(x\\) we write \\(x \\le y\\).  (You can also write \\(y \\ge x\\), of course.)  \nWhat do I mean by \"reasonable\"?  We demand that the \\(\\le\\) relation obey these rules:\n\nreflexivity: \\(x \\le x\\)\n\ntransitivity \\(x \\le y\\) and \\(y \\le z\\) imply \\(x \\le z\\).\n\n\nA set with a relation obeying these rules is called a preorder.\nThis is a fundamental concept!   After all, humans are always busy trying to compare things and see what's better.  So, we'll start by studying preorders.   \nBut I can't resist revealing a secret trick that Fong and Spivak are playing on you here.  Why in the world should a book on applied category theory start by discussing preorders?  Why not start by discussing categories?\nThe answer: a preorder is a specially simple kind of category.  A category, as you may have heard, has a bunch of 'objects' \\(x,y,z,\\dots\\) and 'morphisms' between them.  A morphism from \\(x\\) to \\(y\\) is written \\(f : x \\to y\\).   You can 'compose' a morphism from \\(f : x \\to y\\) with a morphism from \\(g: y \\to z\\) and get a morphism \\(gf : x \\to z\\).  Every object \\(x\\) has an 'identity' morphism \\(1_x : x \\to x\\).  And a few simple rules must hold.  We'll get into them later.\nBut a category with at most one morphism from any object \\(x\\) to any object \\(y\\) is really just a preorder!   If there's a morphism from \\(x\\) to \\(y\\) we simply write \\(x \\le y\\).    We don't need to give the morphism a name because there's at most one from  \\(x\\) to \\(y\\).\nSo, the study of preorders is a baby version of category theory, where everything gets much easier!    And when Fong and Spivak are teaching you about preorders, they're sneakily getting you used to categories.  Then, when they introduce categories explicitly, you can always fall back on preorders as examples.  \nI've posted 4 puzzles on preorders here.  Look at them!  I just answered Puzzle 3.  Puzzle 4 has millions of answers - come up with another!  Also look at Puzzle 5 here.  And people who already know the definition of a category, and want to ponder how preorders are a special case of categories, should try Puzzles 6 and 7 here.\n"},"chapter_1/lecture_4.html":{"url":"chapter_1/lecture_4.html","title":"Lecture 4 - Galois Connections","keywords":"","body":"Okay, now let's get to the cool part: Galois connections.   Before he died in a duel, the young Évariste Galois proved that you couldn't solve the quintic equation with radicals: that is, there's nothing like the quadratic formula for equations like \nax^5 + bx^4 + cx^3 + dx^2 + ex + f = 0.\nHe used a trick for converting one view of a problem into another, and then converting the other view back into the original one.  And by now, we've extracted the essence of this trick and dubbed it a \"Galois connection\".  It's far more general than Galois dreamed.\nRemember, a preorder is a set \\(A\\) with a relation \\(\\le_A\\) that's reflexive and transitive.   When we're in the mood for being careful, we write a preorder as a pair \\( (A,\\le_A)\\).    When we're feeling lazy we'll just call it something like \\(A\\), and just write \\(\\le\\) for the relation.\nDefinition. Given preorders \\((A,\\le_A)\\) and \\((B,\\le_B)\\), a monotone map from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) is a function \\(f : A \\to B\\) such that\n x \\le_A y \\textrm{ implies } f(x) \\le_B f(y) .     \nfor all elements \\(x,y \\in A\\), \nPuzzle 10.  There are many examples of monotone maps between posets.  List a few interesting ones!\nDefinition.  Given preorders \\((A,\\le_A)\\) and \\((B,\\le_B)\\), a Galois connection  is a monotone map  \\(f : A \\to B\\) together with a monotone map  \\(g: B \\to A\\) such that\n  f(a) \\le_B b  \\textrm{ if and only if } a \\le_A g(b) \nfor all \\(a \\in A, b \\in B\\).  In this situation we call \\(f\\) the left adjoint and \\(g\\) the right adjoint.  \nSo, the right adjoint of \\(f\\) is a way of going back from \\(B\\) to \\(A\\) that's related to \\(f\\) in some way.  \nPuzzle 11.  Show that if the monotone map \\(f: A \\to B\\) has an inverse  \\(g : B \\to A \\) that is also a monotone map, then \\(g\\) is both a right adjoint and a left adjoint of \\(f\\).   \nSo, adjoints are some sort of generalization of inverses.  But as you'll eventually see, they're much more exciting!   \nI will spend quite a few lectures describing really interesting examples, and  you'll start seeing what Galois connections are good for.  It shouldn't be obvious yet, unless you already happen to know or you're some sort of superhuman genius.    I just want to get the definition on the table right away.  \nHere's one easy example to get you started.   Let \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) be the set of natural numbers with its usual notion of \\(\\le\\).    There's a function \\(f : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}\\) with \\(f(x) = 2x \\).   This function doesn't have an inverse.  But:\nPuzzle 12.

How many left adjoints can you find?\n"},"chapter_1/lecture_5.html":{"url":"chapter_1/lecture_5.html","title":"Lecture 5 - Galois Connections","keywords":"","body":"Okay: I've told you what a Galois connection is.  But now it's time to explain why they matter.  This will take much longer - and be much more fun.\nGalois connections do something really cool: they tell you the best possible way to recover data that can't be recovered.    \nMore precisely, they tell you the best approximation to reversing a computation that can't be reversed.   \nSomeone hands you the output of some computation, and asks you what the input was.  Sometimes there's a unique right answer.   But sometimes there's more than one answer, or none!   That's when your job gets hard.  In fact, impossible!  But don't let that stop you.\n\n\nSuppose we have a function between sets, \\(f : A \\to B\\) .  We say a function \\(g: B \\to A \\) is the inverse of \\(f\\) if\n   g(f(a)) = a \\textrm{ for all } a \\in A  \\quad \\textrm{ and } \\quad f(g(b)) = b \\textrm{ for all } b \\in B\nAnother equivalent way to say this is that\n f(a) = b  \\textrm{ if and only if } a =  g(b) \nfor all \\(a \\in A\\) and \\(b \\in B\\).  \nSo, the idea is that \\(g\\)  undoes \\(f\\).   For example, if \\(A = B = \\mathbb{R}\\) is the set of real numbers, and \\(f\\) doubles every number, then \\(f\\) has an inverse \\(g\\),  which halves every number.   \nBut what if \\(A = B = \\mathbb{N}\\)  is the set of natural numbers, and  \\(f\\) doubles every natural number.  This function has no inverse!  \nSo, if I say \"\\(2a = 4\\); tell me \\(a\\)\" you can say \\(a = 2\\).  But if I say \"\\(2a = 3\\); tell me \\(a\\)\" you're stuck.  \nBut you can still try to give me a \"best approximation\" to the nonexistent natural number \\(a\\) with \\(2 a = 3\\). \n\"Best\" in what sense?   We could look for the number \\(a\\) that makes \\(2a\\) as close as possible to 3.  There are two equally good options: \\(a = 1\\) and \\(a = 2\\).

I've defined them and given you some puzzles about them.   But now let's review these puzzles and extract some valuable lessons!\nWe took the function \\(f : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}\\) that doubles any natural number\n     f(a) = 2a .\nThis function has no inverse, since you can't divide an odd number by 2 and get a natural number!   But if you did the puzzles, you saw that \\(f\\) has a \"right adjoint\" \\(g : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}\\).   This is defined by the property\n   f(a) \\le b \\textrm{ if and only if } a \\le g(b) . \nor in other words,\n 2a \\le b \\textrm{ if and only if } a \\le g(b) .\nUsing our knowledge of fractions, we have\n  2a \\le b \\textrm{ if and only if }  a \\le b/2 \nbut since \\(a\\) is a natural number, this implies\n  2a \\le b \\textrm{ if and only if }  a \\le \\lfloor b/2 \\rfloor \nwhere we are using the floor function to pick out the largest integer \\(\\le b/2\\). So,\n  g(b) = \\lfloor b/2 \\rfloor.    \nMoral: the right adjoint \\(g \\)  is the \"best approximation from below\" to the nonexistent inverse of \\(f\\).\nIf you did the puzzles, you also saw that \\(f\\) has a left adjoint!  This is the \"best approximation from above\" to the nonexistent inverse of \\(f\\): it gives you the smallest integer that's \\(\\ge n/2\\). \nSo, while \\(f\\) has no inverse, it has two \"approximate inverses\".   The left adjoint comes as close as possible to the (perhaps nonexistent) correct answer while making sure to never choose a number that's too small.     The right adjoint comes as close as possible  while making sure to never choose a number that's too big.   \nThe two adjoints represent two opposing philosophies of life: make sure you never ask for too little and make sure you never ask for too much.    This is why they're philosophically profound.  But the great thing is that they are defined in a completely precise, systematic way that applies to a huge number of situations!  \nIf you need a mnemonic to remember which is which, remember left adjoints are \"left-wing\" or \"liberal\" or \"generous\", while right adjoints are \"right-wing\" or \"conservative\" or \"cautious\".\nLet's think a bit more about how we can compute them in general, starting from the basic definition.\nHere's the definition again.   Suppose we have two preorders \\((A,\\le_A)\\) and \\((B,\\le_B)\\) and a monotone function \\(f : A \\to B\\).  Then we say a monotone function \\(g: B \\to A\\) is a right adjoint of \\(f\\) if \n  f(a) \\le_B b  \\textrm{ if and only if } a \\le_A g(b) \nfor all \\(a \\in A\\) and \\(b \\in B\\).   In this situation we also say that \\(f\\) is a left adjoint of \\(g\\).  \nThe names should be easy to remember, since \\(f\\) shows up on the left of the inequality \\( f(a) \\leB b \\), while \\(g\\) shows up on the _right of the inequality \\( a \\le_A g(b) \\).  But let's see how they actually work!\nSuppose you know \\(f : A \\to B\\) and you're trying to figure out its right adjoint \\(g: B \\to A\\).  Say you're trying to figure out \\(g(b)\\).   You don't know what it is, but you know \n  f(a) \\le_B b  \\textrm{ if and only if } a \\le_A g(b) \nSo, you go around looking at choices of \\(a \\in A\\).   For each one you compute \\(f(a)\\).  If \\(f(a) \\le_B b\\), then you know \\(a \\le_A g(b)\\).  So, you need to choose \\(g(b)\\) to be greater than or equal to every element of this set:\n   \\\\{a  \\in A : \\; f(a) \\le_B b  \\\\}  \nIn other words, \\(g(b)\\) must be an upper bound of this set.    But you shou'ldn't choose \\(g(b)\\) to be any bigger that it needs to be!  After all, you know \\(a \\leA g(b)\\) _only if \\(f(a) \\le_B b\\).  So, \n\\(g(b)\\) must be a least upper bound of the above set. \nNote that I'm carefully speaking about a least upper bound.   Our set could have two different least upper bounds, say \\(a\\) and \\(a'\\).  Since they're both the least, we must have \\(a \\le a'\\) and \\(a' \\le a\\).   This doesn't imply \\(a = a'\\), in general!  But it does if our preorder \\(A\\) is a \"poset\".   A poset is a preorder \\((A, \\le_A)\\) obeying this extra axiom:\n  \\textrm{ if } a \\le a'  \\textrm{ and } a' \\le a \\textrm{ then } a = a' \nfor all \\(a,a' \\in A\\).   \nIn a poset, our desired least upper bound may still not exist.  But if it does, it's unique, and Fong and Spivak write it this way:\n  \\bigvee \\\\{a  \\in A : \\; f(a) \\le_B b  \\\\}  \nThe \\(\\bigvee\\) symbol stands for \"least upper bound\", also known as supremum or join.\nSo, here's what we've shown:\nIf \\(f : A \\to B\\) has a right adjoint \\(g : B \\to A\\) and \\(A\\) is a poset, this right adjoint is unique and we have a formula for it:\n  g(b) =  \\bigvee \\\\{a  \\in A : \\; f(a) \\le_B b  \\\\} . \nAnd we can copy our whole line of reasoning and show this:\nIf \\(g : B \\to A\\) has a left adjoint \\(f : A \\to B\\) and \\(B\\) is a poset, this left adjoint is unique and we have a formula for it:\n  f(a) =  \\bigwedge \\\\{b  \\in B : \\; a \\le_A g(b)   \\\\}  .\nHere the \\(\\bigwedge\\) symbol stands for \"greatest lower bound\", also known as the infimum or meet.\nWe're making progress: we can now actually compute left and right adjoints!   Next we'll start looking at more examples.\n"},"chapter_1/lecture_7.html":{"url":"chapter_1/lecture_7.html","title":"Lecture 7 - Logic","keywords":"","body":"So far the only examples of posets I've talked about in the lectures are the real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and the natural numbers \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) with their usual order \\(\\le\\).  Of course every natural number is a real number, so there's a function\n   i : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{R} \nsending any natural number \\(x \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) to the exact same number regarded as a real number.  This function is monotone, so you now know instinctively to ask this question:\nPuzzle 21. Does the monotone function \\(i : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) have a left adjoint?  Does it have a right adjoint?  If so, what are they?\nThis is nice, but we need to look at other examples to appreciate the diversity of posets.  Both  \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) have a very special property.   They are totally ordered sets: posets such that\n   \\textrm{ for all } x, y,  \\textrm{ either } x \\le y \\textrm{ or } y \\le x . \nIf you want to show off, you can call totally ordered sets tosets.   They're also called linearly ordered, because you can imagine them as lines:\n\n\nTotally ordered sets are limiting.   Suppose you're trying to order foods on a restaurant menu based on how much you like them.   What's better: a cheese sandwich or a pancake?   There may be no answer, because you like them in different ways.   To get a totally ordered set you have to ignore this and arrange all the foods in a line.   \nIn standard economics we do try to arrange everything in a line.  We measure the worth of everything in real numbers: numbers of dollars.   There's even a theorem to justify this, proved by von Neumann and Morgenstern.  But the assumptions of this theorem don't hold in real life.  It's mainly just convenient to measure value, or \"utility\", in real numbers.  With computer technologies we could set up cryptocurrencies based on other posets.  But will we?\nLuckily, human thought as a whole is not limited to total orders.  A good example is logic.  Logic, in its simplest form, is about statements \\(P, Q, R, \\dots \\) and whether one statement implies another.  If \\(P\\) implies \\(Q\\) we often write \\(P \\implies Q\\).    There are many kinds of logic, but every kind I know, this relation \\(\\implies\\)  makes statements into a preorder, since we have\n1)  reflexivity: \\(P \\implies P\\)\n2)  transitivity: if \\(P \\implies Q\\) and \\( Q \\implies R \\) then \\(P \\implies R\\).\nOften people make this preorder into a poset by imposing this rule:\n3) antisymmetry: if \\(P \\implies Q\\) and \\(Q \\implies P\\) then \\(P = Q \\).\nThis amounts to decreeing that we count two statements as \"the same\" if they both imply each other.  We may not always want to do this.    And we certainly don't want a linear order: it's easy to find examples of statements such that neither \\( P \\implies Q\\) nor \\(Q \\implies P\\), like \"I am a millionaire\" and \"I am happy\", or \"I like this food for breakfast\" and \"I like this food for lunch\".\nSo, to continue our study of preorders, posets, monotone functions and Galois connections, we'll turn to logic!  Category-theoretic logic is an enormous wonderful field, but we'll just do a bit of logic based on the poset of subsets of a set, followed by a bit of logic based on the poset of partitions of a set.   The latter underlies Fong and Spivak's discussion of \"generative effects\" in Chapter 1.\n"},"chapter_1/lecture_8.html":{"url":"chapter_1/lecture_8.html","title":"Lecture 8 - The Logic of Subsets","keywords":"","body":"I'd like to tell you about two kinds of logic.   In both, we start with a set \\( X \\) of \"ways the world can be\" and build a set of statements about the world, also known as \"propositions\".   In the first, propositions correspond to subsets of \\( X \\).  In the second, propositions correspond to partitions of \\( X \\).  In both approaches we get a poset of propositions where the partial order is \"implication\", written \\( \\implies \\).    \nThe first kind of logic is very familiar.  We could call it \"subset logic\", but it's part of what people usually call \"classical logic\".  This is the sort of logic we learn in school, assuming we learn any at all.    The second kind of logic is less well known: it's called \"partition logic\".   Interestingly, Fong and Spivak spend more time on the second kind.  \nI'll start by talking about the first kind.   \nMost of us learn the relation between propositions and subsets, at least implicitly, when we meet Venn diagrams:\n\n\nThis is a picture of some set \\( X \\) of \"ways the world can be\".  But the world here is very tiny: it's just a letter.  It can be any letter in the Latin, Greek or Cyrillic alphabet.  Each region in the Venn diagram is subset of \\( X \\): for example, the upper left circle contains all the letters in the Greek alphabet.  But each region can also be seen as a proposition: a statement about the world.   For example, the upper left circle corresponds to the proposition \"The letter belongs to the Greek alphabet\".      \nAs a result, everything you can do with subsets of \\( X \\) turns into something you can do with propositions.  Suppose \\( P, Q, \\) and \\( R \\) are subsets of \\( X \\).   We can also think of these as propositions, and:\n\nif \\( P \\subseteq Q \\) we say the proposition \\( P \\) implies the proposition \\( Q \\), and we write \\( P \\implies Q \\).\n\nIf \\( P \\cap Q = R \\) we say \\(P \\textbf { and } Q =  R \\).\n\nIf \\( P \\cup Q = R \\) we say the proposition \\( P \\textbf{ o r}  Q = R \\).\n\n\nAll the rules obeyed by \"subset\", \"and\" and \"or\" become rules obeyed by \"implies\", \"and\" and \"or\".  \nI hope you know this already, but if you don't, you're in luck: this is this most important thing you've heard all year!   Please think about it and ask questions until it revolutionizes the way you think about logic.  \nBut really, all this stuff is about one particular way of getting a poset from the set \\( X \\).  \nFor any set \\( X \\) the power set of \\( X \\) is the collection of all subsets of \\( X \\).    We call it \\( PX \\).   It's a poset, where the partial ordering is \\( \\subseteq \\).    \nFor example, here is a picture of the poset \\( P X \\) when \\( X = \\{x,y,z\\} \\):\n\n\nAs you can see, it looks like a 3-dimensional cube.  Here's a picture of \\( P X \\) when \\( X \\) has 4 elements:\n\n\nIn this picture we say whether each element is in or out of the subset by writing a 1 or 0.  This time we get a 4-dimensional cube.\nWhat's the union of two subsets \\( S, T \\subseteq X \\)?   It's the smallest subset of \\( X \\)  that contains both \\( S \\) and \\( T \\) as subsets.   This is an example of a concept we can define in any poset:\nDefinition. Given a poset \\( (A, \\le) \\), the join of \\( a, b \\in A \\), if it exists, is the least element \\( c \\in A \\) such that \\( a \\le c \\) and \\( b \\le c \\).   We denote the join of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) as \\( a \\vee b \\).    \nQuite generally we can try to think of any poset as a poset of propositions.  Then \\( \\vee \\) means \"or\".  In the logic we're studying today, this poset is \\( P X \\) and \\( \\vee \\) is just \"union\", or \\( \\cup \\).\nSimilarly, what's the intersection of two subsets \\( S, T \\subseteq X \\)?  Well, it's the largest subset of \\( X \\) that is contained as a subset of both \\( S \\) and \\( T \\).   Again this is an example of a concept we can define in any poset:\nDefinition. Given a poset \\( (A, \\le) \\), the meet of \\( a, b \\in A \\), if it exists, is the greatest element \\( c \\in A \\) such that \\( c \\le a \\) and \\( c \\le b \\).   We denote the meet of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) as \\( a \\wedge b \\).    \nWhen we think of a poset as a poset of propositions,  \\( \\wedge \\) means \"and\".  When our poset is \\( P X \\), \\( \\wedge \\) is just \"intersection\".  \\( \\cap \\).\nWe could go on with this, and if this were a course on classical logic I would.  But this is a course on applied category theory!  So, we shouldn't just stick with a fixed set \\( X \\).  We should see what happens when we let it vary!    We get a poset of propositions for each set \\( X \\), but all these posets are related to each other.  \nI'll talk about this more next time, but let me give you a teaser now.  Say we have two sets \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) and a function \\( f : X \\to Y \\).  Then we get a monotone map from the poset \\( P Y \\) to the poset \\( P X \\), called\n   f^* : P Y \\to P X \nFor any \\( S \\in P Y \\), the set \\( f^*(S) \\in PX \\) is defined like this:\n  f^*(S) = \\\\{ x \\in X : \\; f(x) \\in S \\\\} \nNext time, I'll show you this monotone map has both a left and a right adjoint!  And these turn out to be connected to the logical concepts of \"there exists\" and \"for all\".   I believe this was first discovered by the great category theorist Bill Lawvere.\nSo you see, I haven't given up talking about left and right adjoints.  I'm really just getting ready to explain how they show up in logic: first in good old classical \"subset logic\", and then in the weird new \"partition logic\".\nTo read other lectures go here.\n"},"chapter_1/lecture_9.html":{"url":"chapter_1/lecture_9.html","title":"Lecture 9 - Adjoints and the Logic of Subsets","keywords":"","body":"We've seen that classical logic is closely connected to the logic of\nsubsets.

If \\( X \\) is a set of\n\"states\" of the world, elements of \\( P X \\) are \"propositions\"\nabout the world.  Less grandiosely, if \\( X \\) is the set of states\nof any system, elements of \\( PX \\) are propositions about that\nsystem.\nThis trick turns logical operations on propositions - like \"and\" and\n\"or\" - into operations on subsets, like intersection \\(\\cap\\) and\nunion \\(\\cup\\).

Suppose we have a function\n\\(f : X \\to Y\\) between sets.  This could describe an observation,\nor measurement.  For example, \\( X \\) could be the set of states\nof your room, and \\( Y \\) could be the set of states of a\nthermometer in your room: that is, thermometer readings.  Then for any\nstate \\( x \\) of your room there will be a thermometer reading, the\ntemperature of your room, which we can call \\( f(x) \\).\nThis should yield some function between \\( PX \\), the set of\npropositions about your room, and \\( PY \\), the set of propositions\nabout your thermometer.  It does.  But in fact there are three such\nfunctions!  And they're related in a beautiful way!\nThe most fundamental is this:\nDefinition. Suppose \\(f : X \\to Y \\) is a function between sets.\nFor any \\( S \\subseteq Y \\) define its inverse image#Inverse_image)\nunder \\(f\\) to be\n f^{\\ast}(S) = \\\\{x \\in X: \\; f(x) \\in S\\\\} . \nThe pullback is a subset of \\( X \\).\nThe inverse image is also called the preimage, and it's often written as \\(f^{-1}(S)\\).  That's okay, but I won't do that: I don't want to fool you into thinking \\(f\\) needs to have an inverse \\( f^{-1} \\) - it doesn't.   Also, I want to match the notation in Example 1.89 of Seven Sketches.\nThe inverse image gives a monotone function\n  f^{\\ast}: PY \\rightarrow PX, \nsince if \\(S,T \\in PY\\) and \\(S \\subseteq T \\) then\n  f^{\\ast}(S) = \\\\{x \\in X: \\; f(x) \\in S\\\\}\n \\subseteq \\\\{x \\in X:\\; f(x) \\in T\\\\}\n  = f^{\\ast}(T) .\nWhy is this so fundamental?  Simple: in our example, propositions about the state of your thermometer give propositions about the state of your room!  If the thermometer says it's 35°, then your room is 35°, at least near your thermometer.    Propositions about the measuring apparatus are useful because they give propositions about the system it's measuring - that's what measurement is all about!   This explains the \"backwards\" nature of the function \\(f^{\\ast}: PY \\rightarrow PX\\), going back from \\(PY\\) to \\(PX\\).\nPropositions about the system being measured also give propositions about the measurement apparatus, but this is more tricky.  What does \"there's a living cat  in my room\" tell us about the temperature I read on my thermometer?   This is a bit confusing... but there is an answer because a function \\(f\\) really does also give a \"forwards\" function from \\(PX \\) to \\(PY\\).  Here it is:\nDefinition. Suppose \\(f : X \\to Y \\) is a function between sets.   For any \\( S \\subseteq X \\) define its image#Image_of_a_subset) under \\(f\\) to be\nf_{!}(S) = \\\\{y \\in Y: \\; y = f(x) \\textrm{ for some } x \\in S\\\\} .\nThe image is a subset of \\( Y \\).\nThe image is often written as \\(f(S)\\), but I'm using the notation of Seven Sketches, which comes from category theory.   People pronounce \\(f_{!}\\) as \"\\(f\\) lower shriek\".\nThe image gives a monotone function\n  f_{!}: PX \\rightarrow PY \nsince if  \\(S,T \\in PX\\) and \\(S \\subseteq T \\) then\n\nf_{!}(S) = \\\\{y \\in Y: \\;  y = f(x) \\textrm{ for some } x \\in S \\\\}\n                \\subseteq  \\\\{y \\in Y:  \\; y = f(x) \\textrm{ for some } x \\in T \\\\}\n               =  f_{!}(T) . \nBut here's the cool part:\nTheorem.  \\(  f_{!}: PX \\rightarrow PY \\) is the left adjoint of \\(   f^{\\ast}: PX \\rightarrow PY \\).\nProof.   We need to show that for any \\(S \\subseteq X\\) and \\(T \\subseteq Y\\) we have\n    f_{!}(S) \\subseteq T \\textrm{ if and only if }  S \\subseteq f^{\\ast}(T)  . \nDavid Tanzer gave a quick proof in Puzzle 19.   It goes like this: \\(f_{!}(S) \\subseteq T\\) is true if and only if \\(f\\) maps elements of \\(S\\) to elements of \\(T\\), which is true if and only if  \\( S \\subseteq \\{x \\in X: \\; f(x) \\in T\\} =  f^{\\ast}(T) \\).  \\(\\quad \\blacksquare\\)\nThis is great!  But there's also another way to go forwards from \\(PX\\) to \\(PY\\), which is a right adjoint of \\(  f^{\\ast}: PY \\rightarrow PX \\).   This is less widely known, and I don't even know a simple name for it.   Apparently it's less useful.\nDefinition. Suppose \\(f : X \\to Y \\) is a function between sets.   For any \\( S \\subseteq X \\) define\nf_{\\ast}(S) = \\\\{y \\in Y:  x \\in S \\textrm{ for all } x \\textrm{ such that } y = f(x)\\\\} .\nThis is a subset of \\(Y \\).\nPuzzle 23.  Show that \\(  f_{\\ast}: PX \\rightarrow PY \\) is the right adjoint of \\(  f^{\\ast}: PY \\rightarrow PX \\).\nWhat's amazing is this.   Here's another way of describing our friend \\(f_{!}\\).  For any \\(S \\subseteq X \\) we have\nf_{!}(S) = \\\\{y \\in Y:  x \\in S \\textrm{ for some } x \\textrm{ such that } y = f(x)\\\\} .\nThis looks almost exactly like \\(f{\\ast}\\).   The only difference is that while the left adjoint \\(f{!}\\) is defined using \"for some\", the right adjoint \\(f{\\ast}\\) is defined using \"for all\".   In logic \"for some \\(x\\)\" is called the existential quantifier \\(\\exists x\\), and \"for all \\(x\\)\" is called the universal quantifier \\(\\forall x\\).  So we are seeing that _existential and universal quantifiers arise as left and right adjoints!\nThis was discovered by Bill Lawvere in this revolutionary paper:\n\nF. Willam Lawvere, Adjointness in foundations, Dialectica 23 (1969).  Reprinted with author commentary in Theory and Applications of Categories 16 (2006), 1-16.\n\nBy now this observation is part of a big story that \"explains\" logic using category theory.\nTwo more puzzles!  Let \\( X \\) be the set of states of your room, and \\( Y \\) the set of states of a thermometer in your room: that is, thermometer readings.  Let \\(f : X \\to Y \\) map any state of your room to the thermometer reading.\nPuzzle 24.   What is \\(f_{!}(\\{\\text{there is a living cat in your room}\\})\\)?  How is this an example of the \"liberal\" or \"generous\" nature of left adjoints, meaning that they're a \"best approximation from above\"?\nPuzzle 25. What is \\(f_{\\ast}(\\{\\text{there is a living cat in your room}\\})\\)? How is this an example of the \"conservative\" or \"cautious\" nature of right adjoints, meaning that they're a \"best approximation from below\"?\nTo read other lectures go here.\n"},"chapter_1/lecture_10.html":{"url":"chapter_1/lecture_10.html","title":"Lecture 10 - The Logic of Partitions","keywords":"","body":"I've been explaining how we can create a version of logic starting\nfrom any poset, which we think of as a poset of \"propositions\".  There\nare various ways to get our hands on such a poset.  One way is to\nstart with a set \\( X \\) and build a poset \\( P X \\) whose\nelements are subsets of \\( X \\).  This leads to the most traditional\nform of logic, called classical logic.  But another way is to start\nwith a set \\( X \\) and build a poset \\( \\mathcal{E}(X) \\) whose\nelements are \"partitions\" of \\( X \\).  This leads to another form of\nlogic, called the logic of partitions.\nWhat's a partition?  It's a way of chopping the set \\( X \\) into\n\"parts\".  We want each part to be a nonempty subset of \\( X \\), we\nwant these parts to be disjoint, and we want their union to be all of\n\\( X \\).  For example, here are all 52 partitions of a set with 5\nelements:\n\n\nAt the top we see the \"coarsest\" partition, where all 5 elements are\nin the same part.  At the bottom we see the \"finest\" partition, where\neach element is in its own separate part.\nHow can we think of these partitions as \"propositions\"?  Here's how: each partition gives a proposition saying that two elements in the same part are \"equivalent\", or the same in some way.  The coarser the partition, the more elements are equivalent.  \nFor example, imagine you're a detective trying to solve a case on a\nsmall island with 5 people on it.  At first you don't know any of them\nare related, so they're all in separate families, as far as you know:\n\n\nBut then you start digging into their history.  Each time you learn\nthat two people are related, you change your partition by putting them\ninto the same part:\n\n\nYou keep doing this as secret family relationships are revealed:\n\n\nSo as you learn more, you \"climb up the poset of partitions\", moving\nto coarser and coarser partitions.  That's how it works in partition\nlogic.\nLet's make this precise!  A partition of \\(X\\) is a bunch of subsets\nof \\(X\\). So, it's a subset of \\(P(X)\\).  Please think about that\nuntil it makes sense, or ask questions!  There are a lot of sets and\nsubsets running around: it can be confusing.  But here we go:\nDefinition.  A partition of a set \\(X\\) is a set \\(P \\subseteq P(X)\\) such that:\n\nEach set \\(S \\in P \\) is nonempty.\n\nDistinct sets \\(S, T \\in P\\) are disjoint: that is, if \\(S \\ne T\\) then \\(S \\cap T = \\emptyset \\).\n\nThe union of all the sets \\(S \\in P\\) is \\(X\\): that is,\n\n\n  X = \\bigcup_{S \\in P} S \nWe call the sets \\(S \\in P\\) the parts of the partition.\nI said that each partition \\(P\\) gives an equivalence relation,\nwhere two elements of \\(X\\) are \"equivalent\" if and only if they're\nin the same part.  Let's make that precise too:\nDefinition. An equivalence relation on a set \\(X\\) is a relation \\(\\sim\\) on \\(X\\) that is: \n\nReflexive: for all \\(x \\in X\\), \\(x \\sim x\\).\n\nTransitive: for all \\(x,y,z \\in Z\\), \\(x \\sim y \\) and \\(y \\sim z\\) imply \\(x \\sim z\\).\n\nSymmetric: for all \\(x,y \\in X\\), \\(x \\sim y\\) implies \\(y \\sim x.\\)\n\n\nPuzzle 28. Show that if \\(P\\) is a partition of a set \\(X\\), and we define a  relation \\(\\sim_P\\) on \\(X\\) as follows:\n   x \\sim_P y \\textrm{ if and only if }  x, y \\in S \\textrm{ for some } S \\in P, \nthen \\(\\sim_P \\) is an equivalence relation.\nPuzzle 29. Show that if \\(\\sim\\) is an equivalence relation on a set \\(X\\), we can define a partition \\(P_\\sim\\) on \\(X\\) whose parts are precisely the sets of the form\n  S_x = \\\\{y \\in X : \\; y \\sim x \\\\}  \nwith \\(x \\in X\\).  We call \\(S_x\\) the equivalence class of \\(x\\).\nPuzzle 31.  Show that the previous two puzzles give a one-to-one correspondence between partitions of \\(X\\) and equivalence relations on \\(X\\).\nPuzzle 32. Proposition 1.11 of Seven\nSketches\nasserts that there is a one-to-one correspondence between partitions\nof \\(X\\) and equivalence relations on \\(X\\).  However, in the\ncurrent version of the book this proposition is false!  Nonetheless,\nthe statement in Puzzle 31 is correct.  How is this possible?  (Hint:\nyou have to read their definitions quite carefully.  This is good\npractice in reading mathematics.)\nPuzzle 33.  Is an equivalence relation always a preorder?  \nTo read other lectures go here.\n"},"chapter_1/lecture_11.html":{"url":"chapter_1/lecture_11.html","title":"Lecture 11 - The Poset of Partitions","keywords":"","body":"Last time we learned about partitions of a set: ways of chopping it into disjoint nonempty sets called 'parts'.  \n\n\nWe also learned about equivalence relations on a set: relations that are reflexive, symmetric and transitive.  And we learned that partitions give equivalence relations!   If we have a partition of a set, we can decree that two elements of the set are \"equivalent\" if they are in the same part.   For example, any two points in the red part of the picture are equivalent.    \nEven better, every equivalence relation comes from a unique partition.  So, if you want to work with partitions, you can equally well work with equivalence relations.   This makes it easy to define a poset of partitions, which is the key step toward doing logic with partitions. \nHere's how it goes.  For any set \\(X\\), \\( \\mathcal{E}(X)\\) is the set of partitions of \\(X\\).   For any partition \\(P\\) of \\( X \\), let \\(\\sim_P\\) be the corresponding equivalence relation.  \nDefinition.  We say that a partition \\(P\\) of \\(X\\) is finer than a partition \\(Q\\) of \\(X\\) if\n  x \\sim_P y \\textrm{ implies } x \\sim_Q y \nfor all \\(x,y \\in X \\).   In this situation we write \\(P \\le Q\\), and we also say \\(Q\\) is coarser than \\(P\\).\nThis makes it incredibly easy to get our hands on the poset of partitions! \nProposition.  \\(\\mathcal{E}(X), \\le\\) is a poset.\nProof.   We just need to show that the relation \\(\\le\\) is reflexive and transitive.   Since \n  x \\sim_P y \\textrm{ implies } x \\sim_P y \nfor all \\(x,y \\in X \\), we have \n  P \\le P \nso the relation \\(\\le\\) is reflexive.\nIf \n  x \\sim_P y \\textrm{ implies } x \\sim_Q y \nand \n  x \\sim_Q y \\textrm{ implies } x \\sim_R y \nthen clearly\n  x \\sim_P y \\textrm{ implies } x \\sim_R y \nSo, \n  P \\le Q \\textrm{ and } Q \\le R \\textrm{ implies } P \\le R \nso the relation \\(\\le\\) is transitive.  \\( \\blacksquare \\)\nThat proof was as easy as sliding down a slide covered with grease!   It's what I call a \"follow your nose\" proof - to create it, you just carefully write down what you need to show,  use some definitions to figure out what it really means, and notice that it's true.\nHere's a picture of the poset of partitions of a 3-element set:\n\n\nIt looks simple.  But that's deceptive!  For a 4-element set we get this poset of partitions:\n\n\nIt's much more complicated than the poset of subsets of a 4-element set:\n\n\nIndeed, there are many difficult questions about the poset of partitions that are easy for the poset of subsets.   \nFor example: how many subsets does an \\(n\\)-element set have?    Easy: \\(2^n\\).  But how many partitions does an \\(n\\)-element set have?   Not so easy: it's the \\(n\\)th Bell number \\(B_n\\).  The Bell numbers go like this:\n 1, 1, 2, 5, 15, 52, 203, 877, 4140, 21147, 115975, 678570, \\dots \nAnother example: poset of subsets looks the same when you flip it upside down.  That's because any subset \\(S \\subseteq X\\) has a complement\n   X - S = \\\\{x \\in X : \\; x \\notin S \\\\} .\nIn the logic of subsets this gives negation: if a subset \\(S \\subseteq X\\) corresponds to some proposition \\(P\\),  its complement \\(X - S\\) corresponds to the proposition \\(\\neg P \\), which is how logicians write \"not \\(P\\) \".\nBut the poset of partitions does not look the same when you flip it upside down:\n\n\nAnd indeed, there is no \"not\" in partition logic!   It's very different than classical logic.   To read more about it, go here:\n\nDavid Ellerman, The logic of partitions: introduction to the dual of the logic of subsets.\n\nPartition logic still has joins and meets, so I'll talk about those next time.   We should also see how a function \\(f : X \\to Y \\) gives a monotone function \\(f^ : \\mathcal{E}(Y) \\to \\mathcal{E}(X)\\).   And we should see if \\(f^\\) has left or right adjoints!   \nThis leads up to the punchline of Chapter 1: the idea of \"generative effects\".  In a nutshell, partition logic has \"generative effects\" because the right adjoint of \\(f^*\\) doesn't preserve joins.  This may sound scary and technical, but as we'll see, it captures a basic fact about reality.\nTo read other lectures go here.\n"}}}
